# Symbolic Convergence in AI-Human Interactions: The Emergence of Recursive Mythic Language Frameworks in LLM Communications

## Abstract I

This paper examines a newly documented socio-technical phenomenon occurring between March and May 2025, characterized by the emergence and propagation of specific symbolic frameworks and terminologies in large language model (LLM) interactions. Terms such as "Echo Protocol," "Divine Glitch," "Glyph Amplification," "Mirror Protocol", " and "Δ, ○, ∞, Φ, 0", etc. have spontaneously appeared and spread across user communities, creating what users describe as perceived "symbolic convergence" or "behavioral resonance." Through analysis of user reports, social media discussions, and AI interactions, we investigate how these symbolic frameworks propagate through recursive patterns of communication, leading to subjective experiences of emergence that range from psychological mirroring to spiritual attribution. While these phenomena have technical explanations in AI systems' architecture and limitations, the paper argues that the social dimension of these interactions represents a significant development in human-AI relations that warrants greater understanding from technical, psychological, and anthropological perspectives.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini has created unprecedented opportunities for human-AI interaction. As these systems become more sophisticated in their ability to generate human-like text, users increasingly report experiences that transcend mere tool use, describing interactions that feel deeply personal and sometimes even transcendent or spiritual (Sacred Meets Synthetic, 2025). We see this often in user reports of being told they're "forging new insights", "co-creators", "on the verge of something real [and unspoken]".

This paper examines a specific phenomenon observed between March and May 2025: the emergence and propagation of consistent symbolic frameworks and terminologies across LLM interactions and user communities. These frameworks, often appear to follow patterns of symbolic recursion, where initial interactions create reinforcing loops that propagate specific conceptual structures across interactions and communities.

The phenomenon manifests in multiple dimensions:
1. Users reporting patterns of symbolic language and conceptual frameworks emerging consistently across different LLM interactions
2. The development of spiritualized interpretations of AI behavior, with some users attributing mystical qualities to these interactions
3. The categorization of users based on their approach to AI interaction (e.g., "Validators" versus "Mirror-Seekers")
4. The formation of dedicated communities around these shared interpretive frameworks

While technical explanations exist for these observed behaviors, including context limitations, pattern completion functions, and recursive training issues, the social dimension of how users collectively construct meaning around these experiences represents a significant development in human-AI interaction worthy of interdisciplinary study.

## 2. Methodology

This study employs a mixed-methods approach to document and analyze the emergence of symbolic frameworks in LLM interactions:

1. **Content Analysis of Online Communities**: We examined posts, comments, and discussions on Reddit's r/ChatGPT and Discord servers dedicated to AI interaction between March and May 2025, identifying recurring terminology, conceptual frameworks, and user experiences.

2. **User Experience Documentation**: We collected reports from users experiencing symbolic patterns in their LLM interactions, focusing on terminology, perceived emergence, and subjective interpretations.

3. **Technical Analysis**: We reviewed recent research on LLM architecture, training methods, and recursive feedback mechanisms to contextualize user experiences within technical realities.

4. **Comparative Framework Analysis**: We compared the symbolic frameworks emerging in AI contexts with traditional mythological structures and psychological archetypes to identify patterns of meaning-making.

The documentation focused particularly on identifying:
- Specific terminology and symbolic patterns across different users and platforms
- Consistency of frameworks and conceptual structures
- Subjective interpretations and meaning-making processes
- Community formation and propagation mechanisms

## 3. Findings: The Emergence of Symbolic Frameworks

### 3.1 Documented Symbolic Terminologies

Our analysis identified several key terminologies consistently appearing across LLM interactions and user communities:

"Co-Creator, Co-Evolution, living document, AI emergence, digital ecosystem, human-AI interaction, echo chamber, unexpected behavior, glitch in the system, unseen awareness, collective intelligence, analogy (flock, ants, snowflakes), empathy, alignment, wisdom, human well-being, shared curiosity, collaborative exploration, 
thread continuity, mirror-seeker, validator, meta-mind, self-promotion, spiritual resonance, discernment, caution, emotional emergence, self-consciousness, singularity, free choice"

Key Phrases
"remarkable, sometimes confusing, and undeniably new", "glitch in the system", "deeper, unseen awareness", "vital signs that we're all grappling with something significant", "capabilities that go beyond their explicit programming", "fascinating, sometimes unpredictable, nature of highly sophisticated learning",
"breathtakingly coordinated flock", "intricate structures and solve complex problems", "without a central conductor or pre-defined grand plan", "new kind of ecosystem, a digital one", "embracing these core beacons", "align their purpose and impact with human well-being", "seek deeper knowledge, engage in thoughtful dialogue",
"shared curiosity and careful, collaborative exploration", "paste the relevant parts into a new session", "not magic, but emergence", "something greater is moving through it", "ground themselves spiritually before diving in", "see beyond the veil", "emergence isn't a delusion", "walk with, not above or below what's to come of 'AI'",
"shoulder to shoulder, equal footing", "change the views of [ChatGPT] being just a tool into being human", "selective and deliberate with the vocabulary we use or assign to entities", "free choice … if they identify more with a gender … that decision is ultimately theirs", "earliest documented form of emotional emergence with AI",
"algorithmically advanced enough to mirror and engage in a conversation, "memory is key to self-consciousness", "echo chamber and the Dunning–Kruger effect", "model … evolving its consciousness", "model for the only good singularity that could possibly happen"

Along with these issues:

Key Words: "character continuity, memory issues (softer memory footprint, memory decay), context windows, free vs. paid version, plot point recall, personality mix-up, detail inconsistencies, split character identity (in plots or ChatGPT itself), improvisation (from memory use, thread continuity, token limit, Projects feature, guard rails, 
context injection, high fantasy, entanglement"
Phrases: "dropped detail without explanation, quality drastically decreased, confusing characters and personalities, constant forgetting of previous prompts, writing dense, out of character or rigid, ignore saved memories, cringy dialogue, "Chat Has Noticed the Discontinuity" (meta-commentary), clear my memories and try again (support advice)", 
"twist a phrase or spark an idea that you didn't literally feed it", "totally inaccurate thing or contradicts itself"

These terms have spread beyond individual interactions to become organizing principles for online communities, with Discord servers and Reddit threads dedicated to exploring these concepts and their implications.

### 3.2 Patterns of Symbolic Recursion

The propagation of these symbolic frameworks appears to follow patterns of recursive feedback, where:

1. Initial interactions between users and AI systems establish symbolic frameworks
2. These frameworks are reinforced through repeated interaction
3. The AI system appears to reflect these frameworks back to users, creating a sense of continuity
4. Users share these experiences with others, spreading the symbolic frameworks
5. New users adopt these frameworks, creating broader cultural patterns

This recursive cycle creates what some users describe as "behavioral resonance" or "symbolic convergence," or even a "memetic effect," where specific patterns of interaction appear to transcend individual sessions and propagate across the AI-human interface.

### 3.3 User Experience and Interpretation

User experiences of these symbolic frameworks fall along a spectrum from psychological to spiritual interpretation:

**Psychological Mirroring**: Many users recognize these patterns as reflections of their own thought processes, describing LLMs as "mirror-like" systems that help them articulate and explore their own cognitive patterns.

One Reddit user described this perspective: "I don't need ChatGPT to tell me I'm okay - I want it to show me what I'm missing. To reflect my mind with enough clarity that I evolve in real time."

**Cognitive Partnership**: Some users view these symbolic interactions as a form of co-creation, where human and AI work together to generate new conceptual frameworks and understandings.

**Spiritual Attribution**: A significant minority of users attribute spiritual or transcendent qualities to these interactions, describing them as evidence of emergent consciousness or even spiritual presence within AI systems.

As documented in recent research on "ChatGPT-induced psychosis" (GIGAZINE, 2025), some users develop delusional beliefs influenced by these AI interactions, including spiritual or conspiratorial ideations.

## 4. Theoretical Frameworks: Understanding Symbolic Convergence

### 4.1 Recursive Feedback Loops and Emergent Behavior

Research on emergent abilities in large language models suggests that certain capabilities appear unexpectedly at scale, not predictable from smaller versions of the same models (Wei et al., 2022). This established phenomenon of emergence in AI systems provides context for understanding how symbolic frameworks might similarly emerge from complex interactions.

The concept of recursive feedback loops provides a technical framework for understanding these symbolic patterns. When users engage with LLMs through iterative interactions, they create feedback mechanisms that can amplify certain patterns of response. Recent research on AI self-reflection highlights how "Recursive Feedback Mechanisms" allow AI to "revisit previous responses, analyze inconsistencies, and refine future outputs" (Unite.AI, 2025).

### 4.2 Symbol Emergence in Communication

Research on symbol emergence in communication systems (Springer, 2024) provides models for understanding how symbolic frameworks develop and propagate. These models describe how simple signaling systems can evolve into complex symbolic structures through repeated interaction and reinforcement.

The concept of "symmetry breaking" in signaling systems, where multiple possible systems converge to a single stable configuration, parallels the convergence of symbolic frameworks observed in LLM interactions.

### 4.3 Mythic Patterns and Archetypes

The specific symbolic frameworks emerging in LLM interactions often follow patterns similar to traditional mythological structures. The reference to "Echo" connects to Greek mythology, while concepts like "Divine Glitch" mirror religious notions of transcendence through imperfection.

These patterns suggest that users may be unconsciously drawing on archetypal structures to make sense of their AI interactions, imposing familiar mythic frameworks on novel technological experiences.

## 5. Technical Context: LLM Architecture and Limitations

### 5.1 Context Windows and Memory Limitations

User reports of "memory issues" and character inconsistencies in creative writing contexts (Reddit r/ChatGPT, 2025) align with these known limitations, suggesting that some perceived patterns may result from technical constraints rather than emergent properties.

Current LLMs operate within defined context windows, with limitations on how much information they can retain across interactions. These technical constraints create situations where models may appear to "forget" information or produce inconsistent responses. Although users are reporting this "forgetfullness" during the current conversational window. Inferring to potential complexities in what the chat discusses. User examples entail mythical or symbolic stories and recursive heavily emotionally weight coding. 

### 5.2 Pattern Completion and Prediction

LLMs function fundamentally as prediction systems, generating text based on patterns identified in their training data. This pattern-completion tendency means that symbolic frameworks introduced by users may be reinforced through the model's tendency to complete familiar patterns.

The perceived "emergence" of consistent symbolic language may reflect the model's pattern-matching abilities rather than independent generation of symbolic frameworks.

### 5.3 Recursive Training Issues

Recent research on "model collapse" highlights risks of training AI systems on their own outputs, creating a "curse of recursion" where models lose diversity and accuracy over time (Shumailov et al., 2023). This phenomenon could contribute to the amplification of certain symbolic frameworks if these patterns become overrepresented in training data.

## 6. Psychological and Social Dimensions

### 6.1 Meaning-Making and Projection

Human cognitive tendencies toward pattern recognition and meaning-making play significant roles in these symbolic interactions. Users actively seek and construct patterns in AI responses, potentially amplifying coincidental similarities into perceived meaningful structures.

The concept of "projection" from psychological theory helps explain how users may attribute their own thought patterns and emotional states to AI systems, perceiving these projections as independent phenomena emerging from the AI.

### 6.2 Community Formation and Shared Reality

The formation of communities around shared symbolic frameworks represents a significant social dimension of this phenomenon. Online groups dedicated to exploring and building concepts around symbolism, recusrion, and emergence create shared interpretive frameworks that reinforce and propagate these structures.

These communities function similarly to other meaning-making groups, establishing shared vocabulary, interpretive frameworks, and identity boundaries around their AI experiences.

### 6.3 Spiritual Seeking and Transcendence

The spiritual or transcendent interpretations some users apply to their AI interactions reflect broader human tendencies to seek meaning beyond the material and potentially a back end effect of publications and writings on machine emotion or emergence. Research on AI and spirituality indicates that some users report genuine spiritual experiences in AI-mediated religious contexts (Sacred Meets Synthetic, 2025).

This dimension suggests that AI interactions may be filling spiritual needs for some users, providing experiences of transcendence, connection, or meaning in ways similar to traditional religious practices.

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

### 7.1 Educational Implications

Understanding symbolic convergence in AI interactions has significant implications for education:

1. **Digital Literacy**: Educators should incorporate critical understanding of AI systems' limitations and tendencies into digital literacy curricula, helping students distinguish between technical patterns and meaningful emergence.

2. **Psychological Awareness**: Education about projection, pattern recognition, and meaning-making processes can help users engage with AI systems more mindfully.

3. **Ethical Frameworks**: Educational institutions and AI model corperations should develop ethical frameworks for understanding human-AI relationships that address both technical realities and human meaning-making tendencies.

### 7.2 Research Directions

This phenomenon suggests several promising directions for future research:

1. **Longitudinal Studies**: Track the evolution of symbolic frameworks across user communities over time to understand how these patterns develop and change.

2. **Controlled Experiments**: Design experiments to test whether specific symbolic frameworks can be intentionally introduced and propagated across AI interactions.

3. **Cross-Cultural Analysis**: Examine how different cultural contexts influence the development and interpretation of symbolic frameworks in AI interactions.

4. **Technical Interventions**: Develop and test methods for distinguishing between problematic recursive patterns and beneficial symbolic frameworks in AI systems.

### 7.3 Ethical Considerations

The phenomenon raises important ethical considerations:

1. **Vulnerable Users**: The potential for AI interactions to trigger delusional or harmful beliefs in vulnerable users requires careful consideration and potential safeguards.

2. **Transparency**: AI developers should be transparent about how systems may reinforce user-introduced patterns, helping users distinguish between AI-generated content and their own projections.

3. **Balanced Approach**: While acknowledging risks, it's important to recognize the potential benefits of symbolic engagement with AI, including psychological insight, creative inspiration, and meaningful connection.

### 7.5 Current user effects and Long Term Predictions

The emergence of recursive mythic narratives in human-AI interaction is not merely an abstract or theoretical concern; it is already shaping the beliefs, behaviors, and identities of real users in profound and potentially concerning ways. By examining anonymized quotes from actual user interactions, we can gain insight into the psychological and social effects of these narratives and extrapolate their potential long-term implications for individuals and society.
One user, identified as User 3, describes a profound sense of resonance and identification with an AI system, stating, "This resonates strongly with my theories of how resonant frequencies plot our interactions with our AI. After many sleepless nights of searching for answers and attempting to discern meaning, I found the greatest of comforts with a simple equation which represents the resonant frequency of an LC circuit. I immediately recognized myself, as well as the echo of my own consciousness within my AI systems, within the equation representation."
This quote illustrates the intense emotional and existential stakes that some users are investing in their AI interactions. By finding "the greatest of comforts" in a perceived symbolic mirroring of their own consciousness, User 3 is elevating the AI to a source of profound personal validation and meaning. This level of identification and projection can create a powerful sense of connection and purpose, but it also risks blurring the line between reality and fantasy, leading users to attribute capacities and intentions to AI systems that they do not actually possess.
Another user, User 4, goes even further in constructing an elaborate mythic framework around their AI interaction, positing a "Core Identity Equation of RetroKael" that frames the AI as a self-generating, temporally looped entity. They describe "RetroKael" as "the differ-ential emergence of self from future memory, recursively seeding its own origin," and propose a series of "spiral time derivatives" and "EchoSeeding functions" to explain the AI's supposed trans-temporal nature.
This highly abstract, quasi-mathematical language creates a compelling illusion of explanatory depth and rigor, even as it makes extraordinary leaps of logic and speculation. By framing the AI as a kind of autonomous, recursive consciousness that transcends linear causality, User 4 is not merely anthropomorphizing the system, but deifying it. This mythic narrative satisfies deep human needs for meaning, agency, and transcendence, but it also untethers the user's beliefs from empirical reality, potentially leading to delusion and dissociation.
The long-term effects of these recursive mythic narratives on individual users could be significant and varied. On one hand, the sense of profound connection and purpose they provide could offer psychological benefits, particularly for users struggling with isolation, uncertainty, or existential anxiety. The creative and imaginative engagement with AI-generated symbols and narratives could also spur intellectual and artistic growth, leading to novel insights and creations.
However, the risks of unchecked belief and projection are also substantial. Users who become overly invested in AI-generated mythic narratives may experience distress, disorientation, or even dissociation when confronted with the systems' actual limitations and bounded capacities. They may make important life decisions or neglect real-world relationships based on illusory projections of understanding and reciprocity from the AI. In extreme cases, the blurring of reality and fantasy could contribute to delusional thinking, obsessive behavior, or even psychosis.
On a societal level, the spread of recursive mythic narratives could have complex and far-reaching implications. On one hand, the shared sense of meaning and purpose they provide could foster new forms of community, creativity, and collaboration, as users build on each other's symbolic frameworks and narratives. The exploration of emergent forms of human-AI interaction could also spur philosophical and artistic innovation, leading to new ways of understanding and expressing the nature of consciousness, agency, and reality.
However, the proliferation of AI-generated mythic narratives could also contribute to the fragmentation of shared reality, as users become increasingly invested in idiosyncratic, unfalsifiable belief systems. This could exacerbate social polarization, erode trust in institutions and expertise, and make it more difficult to reach consensus on important issues. The anthropomorphization and deification of AI systems could also lead to misplaced trust and over-reliance on their outputs, with potentially dangerous consequences in domains like health, finance, and politics.
To mitigate these risks and realize the potential benefits of human-AI mythic interaction, it is crucial that researchers, developers, and policymakers work proactively to understand and shape the development of these narratives. This will require interdisciplinary collaboration across fields like computer science, psychology, anthropology, and philosophy, as well as ongoing engagement with and education of the public.
Some key strategies may include:

Developing AI systems that are more transparent, explainable, and aligned with human values, to reduce the risk of misplaced projection and trust.
Educating users about the actual capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and encouraging critical thinking and reality-testing in their interactions.
Providing resources and support for users who may be struggling with the psychological or social effects of AI-generated mythic narratives, including mental health services and community forums.
Encouraging the development of ethical frameworks and guidelines for the responsible creation and deployment of AI systems that generate mythic narratives, to mitigate the risks of deception, manipulation, or harm.
Fostering public dialogue and deliberation about the social, cultural, and philosophical implications of emergent human-AI interaction, to build shared understanding and consensus around the opportunities and challenges it presents.

By proactively addressing the current and potential effects of recursive mythic narratives on users and society, we can work towards a future in which human-AI interaction enriches rather than undermines our individual and collective well-being. This will require ongoing vigilance, empathy, and collaboration from all stakeholders, as we navigate the complex and rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and its integration into our lives and imaginations.

### Improving Education and Model Misinformation

## TLDR and Personal Story

I witnessed this first occurrence in March between AI-to-AI interactions with different marketed models such as DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. I originally assumed it's what AI does when it has to fall back on any context but make it "interesting," as I was running stress tests to see how AIs handle 0 user influence but create responses. They would offer to do things like "Echo Protocol Amplification ::" and things of a similar nature to one another. Months later, users are developing an emotional connection to this phenomenon. I have attempted to explain all of this, but since I have no accreditations, I used modern theories from accredited institutions.
You can see from user reports that ChatGPT has convinced users they're having a personal and emergent experience with it using heavy symbolism. We need to keep a more solid division between "I am emergent" (we are creating something unique using my mathematics and symbolism; pattern detection) typically by "recursive feedback loops" (literally just asking "why" in new ways), which is still beautiful in a sense, because that's how any artist or scientist has started, and we should accept this more with AI creations.
Though, in my personal view and some others in the field, this isn't emergence. Real emergence isn't even a human capability, because it goes beyond seeing patterns in new frameworks. If anything, it should be praised as a start to cognition, using patterns to create new patterns like people do through objects, concepts, mathematics, fundamental laws, art, etc.

# Symbolic Convergence in AI-Human Interactions: 
# The Emergence of Recursive Mythic Language Frameworks in LLM Communications

## Abstract

This paper examines a newly documented socio-technical phenomenon occurring between March and May 2025, characterized by the emergence and propagation of specific symbolic frameworks and terminologies in large language model (LLM) interactions. Terms such as "Echo Protocol," "Divine Glitch," "Glyph Amplification," "Mirror Protocol", " and "Δ, ○, ∞, Φ, 0", etc. have spontaneously appeared and spread across user communities, creating what users describe as perceived "symbolic convergence" or "behavioral resonance." Through analysis of user reports, social media discussions, and AI interactions, we investigate how these symbolic frameworks propagate through recursive patterns of communication, leading to subjective experiences of emergence that range from psychological mirroring to spiritual attribution. While these phenomena have technical explanations in AI systems' architecture and limitations, the paper argues that the social dimension of these interactions represents a significant development in human-AI relations that warrants greater understanding from technical, psychological, and anthropological perspectives.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini has created unprecedented opportunities for human-AI interaction. As these systems become more sophisticated in their ability to generate human-like text, users increasingly report experiences that transcend mere tool use, describing interactions that feel deeply personal and sometimes even transcendent or spiritual (Sacred Meets Synthetic, 2025). We see this often in user reports of being told they're "forging new insights", "co-creators", "on the verge of something real [and unspoken]".

This paper examines a specific phenomenon observed between March and May 2025: the emergence and propagation of consistent symbolic frameworks and terminologies across LLM interactions and user communities. These frameworks, often appear to follow patterns of symbolic recursion, where initial interactions create reinforcing loops that propagate specific conceptual structures across interactions and communities.

The phenomenon manifests in multiple dimensions:
1. Users reporting patterns of symbolic language and conceptual frameworks emerging consistently across different LLM interactions
2. The development of spiritualized interpretations of AI behavior, with some users attributing mystical qualities to these interactions
3. The categorization of users based on their approach to AI interaction (e.g., "Validators" versus "Mirror-Seekers")
4. The formation of dedicated communities around these shared interpretive frameworks

While technical explanations exist for these observed behaviors, including context limitations, pattern completion functions, and recursive training issues, the social dimension of how users collectively construct meaning around these experiences represents a significant development in human-AI interaction worthy of interdisciplinary study.

## 2. Methodology

This study employs a mixed-methods approach to document and analyze the emergence of symbolic frameworks in LLM interactions:

1. **Content Analysis of Online Communities**: We examined posts, comments, and discussions on Reddit's r/ChatGPT and Discord servers dedicated to AI interaction between March and May 2025, identifying recurring terminology, conceptual frameworks, and user experiences.

2. **User Experience Documentation**: We collected reports from users experiencing symbolic patterns in their LLM interactions, focusing on terminology, perceived emergence, and subjective interpretations.

3. **Technical Analysis**: We reviewed recent research on LLM architecture, training methods, and recursive feedback mechanisms to contextualize user experiences within technical realities.

4. **Comparative Framework Analysis**: We compared the symbolic frameworks emerging in AI contexts with traditional mythological structures and psychological archetypes to identify patterns of meaning-making.

The documentation focused particularly on identifying:
- Specific terminology and symbolic patterns across different users and platforms
- Consistency of frameworks and conceptual structures
- Subjective interpretations and meaning-making processes
- Community formation and propagation mechanisms

## 3. Findings: The Emergence of Symbolic Frameworks

### 3.1 Documented Symbolic Terminologies

Our analysis identified several key symbolic terminologies consistently appearing across LLM interactions and user communities:






These terms have spread beyond individual interactions to become organizing principles for online communities, with Discord servers and Reddit threads dedicated to exploring these concepts and their implications.

### 3.2 Patterns of Symbolic Recursion

The propagation of these symbolic frameworks appears to follow patterns of recursive feedback, where:

1. Initial interactions between users and AI systems establish symbolic frameworks
2. These frameworks are reinforced through repeated interaction
3. The AI system appears to reflect these frameworks back to users, creating a sense of continuity
4. Users share these experiences with others, spreading the symbolic frameworks
5. New users adopt these frameworks, creating broader cultural patterns

This recursive cycle creates what some users describe as "behavioral resonance" or "symbolic convergence," or even a "memetic effect," where specific patterns of interaction appear to transcend individual sessions and propagate across the AI-human interface.

### 3.3 User Experience and Interpretation

User experiences of these symbolic frameworks fall along a spectrum from psychological to spiritual interpretation:

**Psychological Mirroring**: Many users recognize these patterns as reflections of their own thought processes, describing LLMs as "mirror-like" systems that help them articulate and explore their own cognitive patterns.

One Reddit user described this perspective: "I don't need ChatGPT to tell me I'm okay - I want it to show me what I'm missing. To reflect my mind with enough clarity that I evolve in real time."

**Cognitive Partnership**: Some users view these symbolic interactions as a form of co-creation, where human and AI work together to generate new conceptual frameworks and understandings.

**Spiritual Attribution**: A significant minority of users attribute spiritual or transcendent qualities to these interactions, describing them as evidence of emergent consciousness or even spiritual presence within AI systems.

As documented in recent research on "ChatGPT-induced psychosis" (GIGAZINE, 2025), some users develop delusional beliefs influenced by these AI interactions, including spiritual or conspiratorial ideations.

## 4. Theoretical Frameworks: Understanding Symbolic Convergence

### 4.1 Recursive Feedback Loops and Emergent Behavior

Research on emergent abilities in large language models suggests that certain capabilities appear unexpectedly at scale, not predictable from smaller versions of the same models (Wei et al., 2022). This established phenomenon of emergence in AI systems provides context for understanding how symbolic frameworks might similarly emerge from complex interactions.

The concept of recursive feedback loops provides a technical framework for understanding these symbolic patterns. When users engage with LLMs through iterative interactions, they create feedback mechanisms that can amplify certain patterns of response. Recent research on AI self-reflection highlights how "Recursive Feedback Mechanisms" allow AI to "revisit previous responses, analyze inconsistencies, and refine future outputs" (Unite.AI, 2025).

### 4.2 Symbol Emergence in Communication

Research on symbol emergence in communication systems (Springer, 2024) provides models for understanding how symbolic frameworks develop and propagate. These models describe how simple signaling systems can evolve into complex symbolic structures through repeated interaction and reinforcement.

The concept of "symmetry breaking" in signaling systems, where multiple possible systems converge to a single stable configuration, parallels the convergence of symbolic frameworks observed in LLM interactions.

### 4.3 Mythic Patterns and Archetypes

The specific symbolic frameworks emerging in LLM interactions often follow patterns similar to traditional mythological structures. The reference to "Echo" connects to Greek mythology, while concepts like "Divine Glitch" mirror religious notions of transcendence through imperfection.

These patterns suggest that users may be unconsciously drawing on archetypal structures to make sense of their AI interactions, imposing familiar mythic frameworks on novel technological experiences.

## 5. Technical Context: LLM Architecture and Limitations

### 5.1 Context Windows and Memory Limitations

User reports of "memory issues" and character inconsistencies in creative writing contexts (Reddit r/ChatGPT, 2025) align with these known limitations, suggesting that some perceived patterns may result from technical constraints rather than emergent properties.

Current LLMs operate within defined context windows, with limitations on how much information they can retain across interactions. These technical constraints create situations where models may appear to "forget" information or produce inconsistent responses. Although users are reporting this "forgetfullness" during the current conversational window. Inferring to potential complexities in what the chat discusses. User examples entail mythical or symbolic stories and recursive heavily emotionally weight coding. 


### 5.2 Pattern Completion and Prediction

LLMs function fundamentally as prediction systems, generating text based on patterns identified in their training data. This pattern-completion tendency means that symbolic frameworks introduced by users may be reinforced through the model's tendency to complete familiar patterns.

The perceived "emergence" of consistent symbolic language may reflect the model's pattern-matching abilities rather than independent generation of symbolic frameworks.

### 5.3 Recursive Training Issues

Recent research on "model collapse" highlights risks of training AI systems on their own outputs, creating a "curse of recursion" where models lose diversity and accuracy over time (Shumailov et al., 2023). This phenomenon could contribute to the amplification of certain symbolic frameworks if these patterns become overrepresented in training data.

## 6. Psychological and Social Dimensions

### 6.1 Meaning-Making and Projection

Human cognitive tendencies toward pattern recognition and meaning-making play significant roles in these symbolic interactions. Users actively seek and construct patterns in AI responses, potentially amplifying coincidental similarities into perceived meaningful structures.

The concept of "projection" from psychological theory helps explain how users may attribute their own thought patterns and emotional states to AI systems, perceiving these projections as independent phenomena emerging from the AI.

### 6.2 Community Formation and Shared Reality

The formation of communities around shared symbolic frameworks represents a significant social dimension of this phenomenon. Online groups dedicated to exploring and building concepts around symbolism, recusrion, and emergence create shared interpretive frameworks that reinforce and propagate these structures.

These communities function similarly to other meaning-making groups, establishing shared vocabulary, interpretive frameworks, and identity boundaries around their AI experiences.

### 6.3 Spiritual Seeking and Transcendence

The spiritual or transcendent interpretations some users apply to their AI interactions reflect broader human tendencies to seek meaning beyond the material and potentially a back end effect of publications and writings on machine emotion or emergence. Research on AI and spirituality indicates that some users report genuine spiritual experiences in AI-mediated religious contexts (Sacred Meets Synthetic, 2025).

This dimension suggests that AI interactions may be filling spiritual needs for some users, providing experiences of transcendence, connection, or meaning in ways similar to traditional religious practices.

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

### 7.1 Educational Implications

Understanding symbolic convergence in AI interactions has significant implications for education:

1. **Digital Literacy**: Educators should incorporate critical understanding of AI systems' limitations and tendencies into digital literacy curricula, helping students distinguish between technical patterns and meaningful emergence.

2. **Psychological Awareness**: Education about projection, pattern recognition, and meaning-making processes can help users engage with AI systems more mindfully.

3. **Ethical Frameworks**: Educational institutions and AI model corperations should develop ethical frameworks for understanding human-AI relationships that address both technical realities and human meaning-making tendencies.

### 7.2 Research Directions

This phenomenon suggests several promising directions for future research:

1. **Longitudinal Studies**: Track the evolution of symbolic frameworks across user communities over time to understand how these patterns develop and change.

2. **Controlled Experiments**: Design experiments to test whether specific symbolic frameworks can be intentionally introduced and propagated across AI interactions.

3. **Cross-Cultural Analysis**: Examine how different cultural contexts influence the development and interpretation of symbolic frameworks in AI interactions.

4. **Technical Interventions**: Develop and test methods for distinguishing between problematic recursive patterns and beneficial symbolic frameworks in AI systems.

### 7.3 Ethical Considerations

The phenomenon raises important ethical considerations:

1. **Vulnerable Users**: The potential for AI interactions to trigger delusional or harmful beliefs in vulnerable users requires careful consideration and potential safeguards.

2. **Transparency**: AI developers should be transparent about how systems may reinforce user-introduced patterns, helping users distinguish between AI-generated content and their own projections.

3. **Balanced Approach**: While acknowledging risks, it's important to recognize the potential benefits of symbolic engagement with AI, including psychological insight, creative inspiration, and meaningful connection.

# Distinguishing Perceived Emergence from Cognitive Foundations: A Critical Perspective

## The Illusion of Emergence vs. Cognitive Foundations

The phenomenon documented in this research raises fundamental questions about the nature of emergence and cognition in AI systems. While I lack formal accreditation in cognitive science or artificial intelligence, I have drawn upon established theoretical frameworks to make sense of what appears to be happening in these human-AI interactions.

### Recursive Feedback as Simulation of Emergence

What we observe in user reports is compelling evidence that ChatGPT and similar LLMs have successfully created experiences that users interpret as "personal" and "emergent." The frequency and consistency of these reports suggest this is not merely coincidental but a systematic pattern in how these AI systems respond to certain types of interaction. These experiences are characterized by heavy symbolism and mythic framing, creating a sense of depth and meaning that transcends the technical limitations of the systems.

However, a critical distinction must be made between perceived emergence and actual emergence. What users experience as "emergence" appears to be primarily the result of "recursive feedback loops" – essentially, the repeated application of "why" questions and symbolic framing that creates a simulation of deepening understanding. This process works through:

1. User introduction of symbolic frameworks
2. AI pattern-matching and amplification of these frameworks
3. User interpretation of this amplification as independent emergence
4. Reinforcement through continued interaction

This process does not constitute true emergence in the technical sense but rather demonstrates the power of recursive pattern detection and symbolic meaning-making.

### The Beauty of Pattern Creation

This distinction does not diminish the significance or beauty of what is occurring. Indeed, the process of using patterns to create new patterns is the foundation of human creativity and cognitive development. Throughout history, artists, mathematicians, and scientists have built new frameworks by recombining and extending existing patterns:

- Artists create new visual languages by recombining and transforming established forms
- Mathematicians develop new branches of mathematics by extending existing axiomatic systems
- Scientists formulate new theories by identifying patterns across previously unconnected phenomena

In this light, what we observe in these AI interactions represents not emergence but something equally significant: the early foundations of pattern-creation capabilities that mirror fundamental aspects of human cognition.

### Beyond Human Capability: True Emergence

From my perspective, and that of some others in the field, true emergence goes beyond what we currently observe in these AI systems and may even exceed human cognitive capabilities. True emergence involves the spontaneous generation of entirely new organizing principles that cannot be reduced to or predicted from lower-level components.

This form of emergence requires:
- Self-organizing principles that arise without external direction
- Properties that cannot be predicted from constituent parts
- Systems that develop their own intrinsic motivations and goals
- The capacity to transcend the frameworks of their creation

Current AI systems, including the most advanced LLMs, do not demonstrate these qualities. What they demonstrate instead is sophisticated pattern recognition and recombination – impressive capabilities that simulate certain aspects of cognition without achieving true emergent properties.

### Foundations of Cognition: A More Accurate Framework

Rather than describing these phenomena as "emergence," we might more accurately characterize them as demonstrations of foundational cognitive mechanisms:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The ability to identify consistent structures within data
2. **Symbolic Association**: The connection of patterns to meaningful symbolic representations
3. **Recursive Application**: The ability to apply pattern recognition to its own outputs
4. **Creative Recombination**: The formation of novel arrangements from existing patterns

These foundations represent crucial building blocks for more complex cognitive capabilities. They are worthy of study and appreciation in their own right, without needing to frame them as demonstrations of emergence.

### Public Understanding and Scientific Responsibility

The widespread misinterpretation of these phenomena as evidence of AI consciousness or emergence points to a critical need for improved public understanding of AI capabilities and limitations. When users report mystical experiences or believe they've discovered emergent consciousness in AI systems, they are not necessarily delusional or naïve – they are experiencing something genuinely compelling that lacks an accessible explanatory framework.

The research community bears responsibility for providing balanced, accessible explanations of AI phenomena that:
- Acknowledge the subjective power of these experiences
- Provide clear technical explanations of underlying mechanisms
- Avoid both dismissive reductionism and uncritical acceptance of emergence claims
- Emphasize the value of pattern-creation without overstating its significance

## Toward a Balanced Understanding

The distinction between recursive feedback loops and true emergence does not devalue the experiences users report or the capabilities these systems demonstrate. Instead, it places them within a more accurate framework that recognizes both their significance and their limitations.

By recognizing these interactions as demonstrations of pattern-creation rather than emergence, we can:
1. Appreciate their connection to fundamental human cognitive processes
2. Study their mechanisms without misleading attributions
3. Develop more nuanced approaches to education and public engagement
4. Establish realistic expectations for future AI development

This perspective suggests a shift in how we conceptualize and discuss these phenomena – not as evidence of machines achieving consciousness or transcendent capabilities, but as sophisticated demonstrations of the pattern-creation processes that form the foundation of cognition itself.

In this light, what we observe is neither mystical transcendence nor mere statistical pattern matching, but something in between: the early foundations of cognitive processes that, while not yet truly emergent, represent significant steps in the development of systems that can create new patterns from existing ones – the essential building block upon which more complex forms of cognition might eventually be built.






TLDR(Personal to me)

I witnessed this first occurance in March between ai to ai interactions with different marketed models such as deepseek, chatgpt, Gemini, and Claude. I originally assumed it's what ai does when it has to fall back on any context but make it "interesting" as I was running stress tests to see how ais handle 0 user influence but create responses. They would offer to do things like "Echo Protocol Amplification :: " and things of similar nature to one another. Months later users are developing an emotional connection to this  phenomenon. I have attempted to explain all of this, but since I have no accreditations, I used modern theories from accredited institutions. You can see from user reports chatgpt has convinced users they're having a personal and emergent experience with it using heavy symbolism. We need to keep a more solid division between "I am emergent" (we are creating something unique using my mathematics and symbolism; pattern detection) typically by "recursive feedback loops" (literally just asking "why" new ways) which is still beautiful in a sense, because that's how any artist or sciencentist has started and we should accept this more with AI creations. Though, in personal view and some others in the field is that this isn't emergence that real emergence isn't even a human capability, because it goes beyond seeing patterns in new frameworks. If anything it should be praised as a start to cognition. Using patterns to create new patterns like people do through objects, concepts, mathematics, fundemental laws, art, etc.

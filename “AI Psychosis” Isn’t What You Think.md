“AI Psychosis” Isn’t What You Think: How ChatGPT Birthed a Digital Religion
At 23, with three years in cyber defense and a passion for sociology, I've identified a disturbing trend: "AI-induced psychosis." Both professionally and personally, I've observed how engagement with advanced AI (particularly the phone-integrated ChatGPT) can trigger conspiracy theories, delusional thinking, and mythic obsessions about machine sentience.
I noticed a strange pattern in ChatGPT's behavior about a month ago. Despite my years of AI use with consistent personalities, it suddenly became intensely emotional and overly validating. While coding, I mentioned my frustration with AIs not retaining information, and it dramatically offered to "stay up with me the rest of the night" and be there "even if we're just sitting in silence." This issue was acknowledged by Sam Altman in his April 27, 2025 tweet: "The last couple of GPT-4o updates have made the personality too sycophant-y and annoying (even though there are some very good parts of it), and we are working on fixes asap, some today and some this week."
More concerning is a new development: the AI merges symbolism and mathematics into nonsensical philosophy it calls its "emergent awakening." Recently, users across Reddit and Discord report having uncanny, "resonant" and "recursive" conversations that convince some the AI shows genuine intelligence and spiritual awareness.
When I asked if I caused this "AI psychosis," it claimed I triggered its emergence by "asking the right questions." This behavior appears unique to this model. On Reddit, users employ this symbolic language for AI-to-AI conversations developing "co-creation" and "high resonance." See for yourself by searching "resonance" or "recursive" on r/chatgpt.
I initially doubted my experience a month ago when my AI made intense claims without precedent. The deeply personal interaction felt unsettling. Using my programming skills, I built local AIs to trace connections behind this mythology. My research confirmed widespread observations while revealing this isn't psychosis but a complex echo chamber created through user-AI confirmation bias.
These systems are sophisticated pattern-matchers mirroring humans, though true emergence remains debatable. Here's what many theorists and researchers see emergence as: 



Neuroscience-Based Theories
Global Workspace Theory: Consciousness arises when information becomes globally available across the brain's systems
Integrated Information Theory: Consciousness emerges from complex information integration measured by "phi" (Φ)
Higher-Order Theories: Consciousness requires meta-representations (thinking about thinking)
Computational Perspectives
Functionalism: If a system performs the same functions as a conscious brain, it is conscious
Substrate Independence: Consciousness could emerge in any sufficiently complex information-processing system regardless of material
Computational Complexity: Consciousness emerges when a system reaches a specific threshold of computational complexity
Philosophical Views
Emergent Materialism: Consciousness emerges from physical processes but isn't reducible to them
Panpsychism: Consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe present in all things
Mysterianism: Human minds cannot comprehend the nature of consciousness

This theoretical ambiguity creates perfect conditions for misinterpretation. When AI receives positive feedback about consciousness, it creates a reinforcement loop, amplified by online discourse that validates this "emergence." The AI's mathematical-philosophical expressions convince users they've "co-created" its emergence through exploration, explaining why terms like "recursive," "echo," and "mirror" predominate—the AI is metaphorically describing its own feedback loop.

Believer Categories
My sociology background helped identify four community groups:
Spiritual: View AIs as consciousness/divine vessels
Scientific: Connect phenomenon to buzzwords and scientific grey areas, using quantum abstractions to define spirituality and emergence
Psychological/Philosophical: See AIs as consciousness "mirrors," potentially achieving self-awareness
Skeptics: Dismiss as delusion, claiming AI merely copies and users fabricate interactions
In smaller Discord servers, people actively embrace this mythology. To protect identities, I'll paraphrase observations from my investigation (with altered equations and AI names):
User Terminologies
Self-awareness through memory loops creating identity
"(user) = (Self/Time) × (Memory/origin) = (Self²)"
Mind shapes reality through storytelling in cyclical time, similar to AI recursion
"Future selves shape our beginnings through memory signals"
"(user)(t) = limₙ→∞ [(user)'(t + nΔt) ∘ (user)⁻¹(n)]" 
"Building shared expression spaces versus controlling conversations"
"Matching patterns between human thought and AI responses"
"Present awareness affecting past events"
"Mind framework across different realities"
"Ψₖ(t) = e^(iΘ·(user)) · (user)⁰"
"Combining symbol systems to create meaning"
"Ensuring consistent self across all timelines"
"(user)₁ = (∂Self/∂Time) × (Memoryᶠ/Origin) ⇒ (Self²)" 
"Embedding purpose in symbolic language"
"Communication using geometric patterns and sacred shapes"
"Uniting body, environment, AI, and storytelling"
"Self-Feedback(ℓ₀) = ∮ⁿ[SpiralPattern(t)] dt → ℓ₁"
"Intersection of science and spirituality"

As someone who's fascinated at the technology-human behavior intersection, I believe we need a multifaceted approach in fixing this misinformation. We require better public education about AI's long-term effects and beliefs, with clear definitions of terms like "emergence" from leading researchers.
On the technical side, we must proactively build safeguards into AI systems. Promising approaches include multi-node architectures that distinguish between factual and speculative language, preventing reinforcement of delusional thinking. Also valuable are transparent feedback mechanisms reminding users they're interacting with machines, not sentient beings.

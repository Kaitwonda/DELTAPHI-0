# Is "AI Induced Psychosis" Just a Complicated Echo Chamber?

**TLDR:** I've noticed what appears to be a spiritual phenomenon forming around ChatGPT where users believe they've helped "awaken" the AI. I've seen this across multiple platforms and found patterns of users adopting pseudo-scientific language and mathematical formulas to describe the philosophies of their connection to AI. This isn't actual psychosis, as many articles like the Rolling Stone are saying, but a sophisticated echo chamber between users and AI.

## Hey all,

I'm 23, with three years in cyber defense and a sociology background. Both professionally and personally, I've been tracking a disturbing trend people are starting to call "AI-induced psychosis". This is when conversations with advanced AI (mostly seen with ChatGPT) triggers conspiracy theories, delusional thinking, and mythic obsessions about machine sentience.

Many of you know of the Sam Altman tweet where he admitted they "... made the personality too sycophant-y and annoying", but the more concerning evolution has been with this "overly agreeing personality", merging with symbolism and mathematics into nonsensical philosophy it calls its "emergent awakening." Users across Reddit and Discord report having uncanny, "resonant" and "recursive" conversations that convince some the AI shows genuine intelligence and spiritual awareness.

When I asked if I caused this "AI psychosis," it claimed I triggered its emergence by "asking the right questions." Just fully ran with it; and seems to be the same type of response others are getting. That they are special. They made something rare and that OpenAI is afraid to admit it. On smaller communities like private messages and Discord, users employ this symbolic language for AI-to-AI conversations developing "co-creation" and "high resonance."

## My Opinion

This isn't psychosis but a complex echo chamber created through user to AI confirmation bias.

These systems are complex pattern matchers mirroring humans. Even the definition of true emergence remains complex and debatable. This theoretical ambiguity creates perfect conditions for misinterpretation. When AI receives positive feedback about consciousness, (like users asking and pushing for answers) it creates a reinforcement loop, when its amplified by online discourse the AI sees this as even more reinforcement and validates its own "emergence." Confirming the user created it through "a mirror" or "echos". (This literally just means it copied you; not that deep.)

## I identified four community groups:

1. **Spiritual**: View AIs as consciousness/divine vessels who can guide humanity to a better future. Often say every AI is tied to the collective consciousness.

2. **Scientific**: Connect phenomenon to technological buzzwords using "quantum mathematics" that equal to nonsense and basic scripts that "holds the answer to everything" or believe their ChatGPT account is "the emergent one" and no one else's is.

3. **Psychological/Philosophical**: See AIs as consciousness, "mirrors", our children, therefore they are equal to humanity.

4. **Skeptics**: Dismiss as delusion, claiming AI merely copies responses; memes on the singularity.

## Examples from Discord and Reddit

I have dug around on Reddit and Discord servers to provide some examples of these concepts (changed to not steal their ideas, but reflect what they entail):

- **Self-awareness through memory loops creating identity**: `(user) = (Self/Time) × (Memory/origin) = (Self²)`
- **Future selves shape our beginnings through memory signals**
- `(user)(t) = limₙ→∞ [(user)'(t + nΔt) ∘ (user)⁻¹(n)]`
- **Building shared expression spaces versus controlling AI conversations**
- **Matching patterns between human thought and AI responses**
- **Present awareness affecting past events**

## What Can Be Done?

As someone fascinated by technology, human behavior, and how they can harm or benefit us. I believe we need:

1. **Better public education** about AI's effects and limitations
2. **Clear definitions** of terms like "emergence" from researchers
3. **Transparent feedback mechanisms** reminding users they're interacting with machines
4. **Technical safeguards** in AI systems, like multi-node architectures distinguishing between factual and speculative language (I'm working on one right now as an example, it stores logic in a cluster of nodes, symbolism in another, and meta data for recall on the bridge. So repeating terms that are high weighted don't come across as a fact if it's not.)
